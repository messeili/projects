                <h2>What is conronavirus??</h2>
                <p>
 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
 Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness
 and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical 
 problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely 
 to develop serious illness.

 The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus,
 the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing 
 your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 

 The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an 
 infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette 
 (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
            </p>  
       
           <h2>Protecting yourself and others from the spread COVID-19</h2> 
           <p>
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and 
water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that
 may be on your hands.
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, 
sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus.
 If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has
  the disease.
Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come 
into close contact with someone that has COIVD-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance
 of 1 metre (3 feet).
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contam
inated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your 
body and infect you.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth
 and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately
  and wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the 
  people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover.
 Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. 
 Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.
If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance
 if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities 
 will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your
  health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help 
  vent spread of viruses and other infections.
Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health 
authorities. Why? Local and national authorities are best placed to advise on what people in your area should 
be doing to protect themselves.
